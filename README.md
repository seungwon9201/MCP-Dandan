## Overview

MCP-Dandan is an integrated monitoring service that observes MCP (Model Context Protocol) communications and detects security threats in real time. It features a modern desktop UI built with Electron for easy monitoring and management.

  - Command Injection Detection
  - File System Exposure Detection
  - PII Leak Detection(custom rules supported)
  - Data Exfiltration Detection
  - Tools Poisoning Detection (LLM-based)
- **Desktop UI**: Electron-based application with interactive dashboard
- **Interactive Tutorial**: Built-in tutorial system for new users
- **Blocking Capabilities**: Real-time threat blocking with user control
- **Cross-Platform**: Supports Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Quick Start
### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/82ch/MCP-Dandan.git
cd MCP-Dandan

# Install all dependencies (Python + Node.js)
npm run install-all

## Detection Engines

### 1. Command Injection Engine
Identifies potential command injection patterns in tool calls.

### 2. File System Exposure Engine
Monitors unauthorized file system access attempts.

### 3. PII Leak Engine (custom rules supported)
Detects potential PII leakage with built-in rules and optional user-defined customization.

### 4. Data Exfiltration Engine
Identifies suspicious data transfer patterns.

### 5. Tools Poisoning Engine (LLM-based)
Uses semantic analysis to detect misuse of MCP tools:
- Compares tool specifications vs actual usage
- Scores alignment (0-100) with detailed breakdown
- Auto-categorizes severity: none/low/medium/high
